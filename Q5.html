                HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. HTML consists of a series of elements that define the structure and content of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. These elements are represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets, such as <p> for a paragraph or <img> for an image.

                    HTML documents are typically saved with a .html or .htm file extension and can be viewed in web browsers. Web browsers interpret the HTML code and display the content of the web page according to the instructions provided by the HTML elements.
                    
                    In addition to defining the structure and content of a web page, HTML can also be used in conjunction with other technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to enhance the appearance and functionality of a website.

                CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. In simpler terms, CSS is used to control the layout, appearance, and design of web pages. It allows developers to separate the content of a web page from its visual presentation, making it easier to style and customize the look and feel of a website.

                Key features of CSS include:
                
                1. Selectors: CSS uses selectors to target specific elements on a web page that you want to style. Selectors can target elements based on their type, class, ID, attributes, or relationship with other elements.
                
                2. Properties and Values: CSS properties define the visual aspects of an element, such as its color, size, font, spacing, and positioning. Each property has a corresponding value that specifies how that aspect should be styled.
                
                3. Cascading: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets because styles can be applied in multiple ways and can cascade down through the document. This means that styles can be inherited from parent elements or overridden by more specific styles.

                JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is commonly used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It is often referred to as the "language of the web" because it is supported by all major web browsers and allows developers to create interactive elements, animations, and other dynamic features on websites.

JavaScript can be embedded directly into HTML documents or included as external script files. It is used to manipulate the content of a web page, respond to user interactions, validate form inputs, create animations, and much more.

Some key features of JavaScript include:

1. Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript runs on the client side (in the user's browser), enabling dynamic updates without requiring a page reload.

2. Event-Driven Programming: JavaScript responds to events triggered by user actions (such as clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs) or changes in the web page.

JavaScript is a versatile language that is widely used in web development alongside HTML and CSS. It continues to evolve with new features and capabilities, making it an essential tool for creating modern, interactive web applications.
